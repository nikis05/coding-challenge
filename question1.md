### Question 1
List a few problems of JavaScript as a language.


### My answer
This discussion is very detailed and opinions on this question will certainly be different.
In my opinion, js has many problems and the reason is that it was designed incorrectly.
Earlier js was designed for another job and from time to time they changed the design of js completely and this caused many problems in this language.
I think any tool, whether related to programming or not related to programming, if it has the wrong API and causes the user to use that tool incorrectly, that tool is very bad, which is exactly what js is because it was designed that way. Where the error rate is very high.
For example, in js I want to give several examples: if a variable is not declared, js does not give an error and goes to the outermost scope which is global scope, and if it can not resolve, it creates this variable and this is very bad for the language, because it is never needed Use the variable we did not declare.
Another example is that if this in a function is undifined, the value of this window object is considered.
